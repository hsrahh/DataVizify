***DataVizify*** 

### **Project Description**  
**DataVizify** is a user-friendly web application designed to help users transform raw datasets into meaningful and visually appealing insights. By simply uploading a dataset file (CSV, Excel, or ZIP), users can generate a variety of visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pie charts. The app is built using Flask for the backend, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and HTML/CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

### **Key Features**  
1. **File Upload**:  
   - Users can upload datasets in CSV, Excel, or ZIP formats.  
   - The app extracts and processes datasets from ZIP files if needed.  

2. **Dynamic Visualizations**:  
   - Automatically generates visualizations based on the dataset's content:  
     - **Line Plots**: For numeric data trends.  
     - **Bar Charts**: For categorical data distribution.  
     - **Scatter Plots**: For relationships between two numeric variables.  
     - **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between numeric columns.  
     - **Pie Charts**: For proportion analysis of categorical data.  

3. **Error Handling**:  
   - Validates file formats and dataset integrity.  
   - Displays user-friendly error messages for unsupported files or issues in the dataset.  

4. **Real-Time Output**:  
   - Visualizations are displayed on the same page after file upload.  
   - Each upload generates a unique set of images stored in the `static/images` directory.  

5. **Seamless UI**:  
   - A clean, responsive interface for an enhanced user experience.

### **How It Works**  

1. **Upload Dataset**:  
   - Users upload a dataset file via the web interface.  

2. **Data Processing**:  
   - The backend processes the uploaded file using **Pandas** to load and analyze the dataset.  

3. **Visualization Generation**:  
   - Visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
   - Both numeric and non-numeric data are handled effectively.  

4. **Display Results**:  
   - Generated visualizations are displayed directly on the web page.
